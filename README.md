# Challenge
The school district discovered that the standardized test scores for ninth grade students at Thomas High School were incorrect, and they requested updated data summaries. On reviewing the options for managing the data within the set, it was determined that the best option was to replace the scores for reading and math of Thomas High School 9th graders with "NaN" - which represents a "Not-a-Number" value. This affected 461 student records from Thomas High School, while keeping all other data associated with this student group intact. 


## Analysis Results. 
A thorough analysis of scores was done after replacing the Thomas High School 9th Grade scores with NaN. As all of the ninth graders from Thomas High School had their scores replaced, the particular focus of the analysis was to determine how the adjustment affected the school district analysis scores. 

Primary areas of focus were:

- Confirmation of the district summary results
- Average math and reading scores at Thomas High School
- Percentage of students passing according to math scores
- Percentage of students passing according to reading scores
- Overall percentage of students who passed both math and reading
- Percentage passing math, reading, and overall by budget per student
- Percentage passing math, reading, and overall by school size
- Placement of schools overall by score values relative to each other
